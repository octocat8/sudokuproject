Developing a Sudoku solving program in Python
Minimum Goals:
-> Program should be able to run a graphical sudoku interface
-> Program should be able to generate new puzzles randomly
-> Program should allow user to play as far as they want
-> Program should be able to solve the given puzzle in whatever state it is in
or
-> Program should state that the problem is unsolvable

Timeline:
Developing the backend code first
Includes
-> Setting up the basic pieces of the puzzle
-> Figuring out how to create sudoku puzzles randomly (preferably solvable all the time)
-> Provide an option for the user to try the game out on their own
-> Develop an algorithm to solve the puzzle
Once that has been tested, converting to a GUI although now that I think about it, creating the GUI first might be a
better idea so that I can have a better understanding as to how to accept input
(Input via CLI will be tough to manage)

Goals:
Enable the algorithm to learn from its errors and thus speed up the solving process
Maybe allow the algorithm to start from scratch when trying to play instead of figuring out from the tricks I know.

Created on July 9th, with a promise to go sit for an hour and learn or create everyday until the project ends.
